Aug 1994 <br><br>A time when you get real pleasure from love, pleasures, or entertaining friends. Pleasant and happy family life. Take this opportunity to express your feelings to people close to you -- you are more likely to be received well today than on other days unless there are very difficult concurrent transits. This is a good time to decorate, beautify, enhance the home, as well as attain some level of harmony in your domestic life. You seem to have a lot of luck. You may meet pleasant people who are fun to be with, or there are happier pastimes and moments. You are good-humored, optimistic, funny, attractive, delighted, radiant, and lively. Your professional life is easier, or at least, goes along with fewer complications. Success comes more readily and there can be some material rewards, a money boost, or a significant gift/bonus. You may take advantage of this by improving comfort levels. You have a sense that helps you grab opportunities.
Sept 1994 <br><br>This may be a time when you're not succeeding through your efforts but through the support you have built up around yourself for this purpose. Or, professional successes can happen now, but they can be debatable. Your personal life is distracting or interfering with your professional life or your responsibilities. Watch out for the competition during the weeks of this transit. Your ambition can be greater than your current means or ability at your disposal, which may cause problems if you can't meet your commitments. This can be a time when your reputation counts more than your qualifications, even if that doesn't make sense, so aim to ride it out.
Oct 1994 <br><br>A period when it's best to lay low, seeking peace and tranquility. Your dreaming world and intuition could be fruitful as they can help guide you along the right path. You are tapping in to your unconscious. It can be difficult to free yourself from the need to dream as much as you might try now. You are especially sensitive to everything around you. At times, it can be hard to distinguish between a dream and reality. As such, it's better to keep some things to yourself for now and to watch for being misled. You might re-examine your work, asking yourself whether you are truly doing well or whether a particular person in your life is truly trustworthy. It may be better to take a break and think things all the way through instead of doing something regrettable or impulsive. Keep in mind that you may be seeing a problem in an exaggerated way just for now.
Nov 1994 <br><br>You feel in top form, energetic, and sharp. You want to move about, go out, and meet new people. You seem to know how to express your ideas in a good-humored way, frankly, sincerely, and convincingly. Generally a good time for business with the possibility of new contracts. This is a fine time to get going on a project or for doing some studying. Your ideas are original, and you want to go your own way with them. Events occurring now put you in touch with your deeper desires and perhaps your darker side. It's a time of useful and perhaps intense self-discovery. You can be impatient with the superficial. You are extremely resourceful and might come up with a great idea for a new venture. It's a good time for business, attracting customers, making sales, and improving your reputation or recognition.
Dec 1994 <br><br>You are in a good mood, business should go well, love life relatively smooth, and your spirits are good. You are appreciating the finer things in life and expanding your horizons. Generally, you are in good humor and others seem to see you in a good light. You are generous with yourself and others now. This can be a time for an amorous adventure or travel to see your heart's choice. This transit can put you in a good mood. Keep things light today. Express your affection, and focus on harmony.  Beware of a tendency to overreact or to go to extremes now. An emotional confrontation is possible. Your moods can affect your interactions. Unresolved emotional issues seem to crop up. Sorting them out can help resolve relationship problems. Events occurring now put you in touch with your deeper desires and perhaps your darker side. It's a time of useful and perhaps intense self-discovery. You can be impatient with the superficial. You are extremely resourceful and might come up with a great idea for a new venture.
Jan 1995 <br><br>A time when you may have difficulty concentrating on your work, especially anything intellectual. It's harder to focus, and arguments are more likely than usual. Watch what you say today, because you can easily misrepresent yourself with your words. This is a time when you can overlook important details, so it is best not to sign contracts or lock something down. It can be an absent-minded time when mistakes are made and distractions are plenty. Don't be surprised if you are not in top mental gear today. You could find yourself struggling to communicate or being easily misunderstood. Hard words are possible.
Feb 1995 <br><br>You feel in top form, energetic, and sharp. You want to move about, go out, and meet new people. You seem to know how to express your ideas in a good-humored way, frankly, sincerely, and convincingly. Generally a good time for business with the possibility of new contracts. This is a fine time to get going on a project or for doing some studying. Your ideas are original, and you want to go your own way with them. This is a time when you see the world from a grander perspective. You see the big picture now, but be careful that it is not at the expense of critical details. Details may be glossed over, and you can be too optimistic at times. However, this transit presents an excellent opportunity to grow mentally and intellectually. Learn everything you can. Your ideas may be appreciated more than ever, so be sure to get your ideas across and put them "out there."
Mar 1995 <br><br>You feel in top form, energetic, and sharp. You want to move about, go out, and meet new people. You seem to know how to express your ideas in a good-humored way, frankly, sincerely, and convincingly. Generally a good time for business with the possibility of new contracts. This is a fine time to get going on a project or for doing some studying. Your ideas are original, and you want to go your own way with them. Key themes of this influence: Positive outlook, a time to correct misunderstandings, excellent for learning. It is difficult to open eyes that have been firmly shut up until now. You could have difficulty assuming your responsibilities, even though you feel you must eventually do so. Problems and life, in general, can feel a little harder than usual or you may feel overwhelmed at times. Remember that this is a cycle and that it makes you stronger, prouder, more confident, and more self-assured.
April 1995 <br><br>Your cravings are big during the several months of this transit. You desire new pleasures, and you more fully appreciate the beautiful things in life. Life is more colorful now! New and interesting acquaintances may come into your life, or someone new may charm you. Renewed soul contacts can be reestablished. Short-lived relationships that are vibrant and very alive can occur and physical attractions to others (and to things) are powerful. Gains can come from unseen sources. Buying, making changes in your life, beautifying, or just splurging on a favorite pleasure are favored. Keeping a grip on reality can be a bit challenging at this time and cases in litigation can take a completely different course due to sudden shocking evidence that comes up. Sometimes clean breaks from the past and others are the best kind and this is not the time to mix business and pleasure. Sudden justices can arrive of the unexplainable kind and relationships can come alive now, taking interesting new paths.
May 1995 <br><br>Some re-structuring of your life and goals is now in order. You may be looking for new challenges, possibly because you are forced to do so. You have a desire to grow and expand, but your attitude is cautious. Perhaps what you want to do is not exactly feasible at this time. It is a better time to breathe new life into old plans rather than to strike out with a new plan altogether. Some caution is needed with your finances, although you might get some help from older or more stable individuals at this time. Something is telling you to push forward and to expand and grow, but with a close eye on your limitations. Take steps to grow, but don't overextend yourself at this time or you are bound to face frustrations. Although you may lack reason and logic at times, on the contrary your psychic faculties (such as inspiration and clairvoyance) are highly tuned. Renewed sense of purpose. You can feel excited about your resources, talents, creative vision, and passions. You can make a difference.
June 1995 <br><br>Your vitality gets a boost. Cooperation comes easily. Friendships and connections are favored. Some calm moments are of great benefit now. A busy time for new ideas, satisfying or colorful communications, and a time of more imagination. You are brighter, more perceptive, and especially thoughtful. Sensitive communications are favored. Good news. This transit helps smooth out the life and is especially helpful if other more challenging aspects are concurrently active. You are in better health with plenty of energy that you know how to channel. You are more outgoing and talkative. Luck seems on your side, and you are ready to achieve the goals you set yourself. A good time for your personal appeal, legal matters, and gaining cooperation from others.
July 1995 <br><br>You are in possession of all your faculties. You can be in astoundingly good form and in extraordinarily good health unless there are very challenging concurrent aspects. You are inclined to throw yourself wholeheartedly into your activities in the run-up to your chosen objective. You seem to succeed in most everything you do. It's a time to overcome even the toughest resistance. This can shape up to be a very good period for you, and it is best to take advantage of it in order to build up a reserve for the future. You are objective, lively, competent, prudent, and calculating. Your imagination doesn't play tricks on you. You have a spirit of adventure and independence. Nevertheless, you weigh up all the possibilities before setting out on any new adventure, preferring not to leave much up to chance. The results are likely to be satisfying.
Aug 1995 <br><br>You are objective, lively, competent, prudent, and calculating. Your imagination doesn't play tricks on you. You have a spirit of adventure and independence. Nevertheless, you weigh up all the possibilities before setting out on any new adventure, preferring not to leave much up to chance. The results are likely to be satisfying. You're determined to make something constructive of your ambitions now. It's a time of working with a purpose, not for sweeping changes. You are finding excellent solutions to basic problems in our life. You have an excellent eye for what works and your focus or projects can subtly change and improve as a result. Patience for making long-lasting changes is rewarded.
Sept 1995 <br><br>This can be a time for an amorous adventure or travel to see your heart's choice. This transit can put you in a good mood. Keep things light today. Express your affection, and focus on harmony.Domestic problems may be part of the picture. Everyday coping skills can be compromised, or chores and routines seem to be harder to do or more burdensome than usual. It can be hard for you to take risks at this time, and you are more inclined to focus on the negatives in your life. Fears and insecurities of all kinds are magnified during this period--fear of rejection, fear of what the future might bring, fear that you won't be able to handle your life masterfully, and so forth. Although you may long for emotional support from others, you may not ask for it or receive it well if it is forthcoming. Watch for a tendency to feel sorry for yourself, although it can be helpful if done in moderation. There is a tendency to dredge up the past and focus on what you haven't done or can't do.
Oct 1995 <br><br>You might feel that you are in full control, wanting to throw yourself into whatever you are doing, but you can be too impatient and too impulsive in words and deeds. You could be clumsy now, both literally and figuratively speaking. You may be impulsive and bold, and, as a result of a lack of forethought, might encounter some problems during this brief transit. For some, there may be a tendency to be aggressive, ambitious, or bossy if these tendencies are there, making it difficult for others to put up with you. You could have problems with your bosses or people in authority if you lack tact or prudence now.
Nov 1995 <br><br>Sometimes, unexpected windfalls come during this transit, but opportunities must be identified and seized. Reasonable investments are generally favored at this time, but it's a good idea to factor in the condition of the natal Sun, as well as the nature of other transits occurring at the same time. If the Sun is challenged, you may not have the best judgment at this time. It's an excellent time to start new long-term projects. You might find that you feel more vital, confident, and optimistic about the future at this time. It's a good time to resolve conflicts. Events may give your ego a boost, and you could be feeling quite vital and alive. Take advantage of this by promoting yourself or putting yourself "out there."
Dec 1995 <br><br>You are in fine form for completing your professional tasks, studies, and communications. Your mind is alert, and ideas come to you naturally. You love talking today, and you get your points across well. It's a good day to express yourself because you are received well. A time for being on the ball and prompt. This can be a time when you act out of proportion or excessively in some manner. Watch for arrogance and a clouded vision. You may take on more than you can handle in the weeks of this transit. Lack of forethought and not enough prudence could lead to problems or setbacks.
Jan 1996 <br><br>You can be somewhat wrapped up in yourself - not very talkative and preferring to stay at home rather than go out with friends. You can be bothered by something someone says. You are more sensitive than usual. Your words may be misunderstood or overlooked. You may be feeling overlooked, left out, on your own, and even uncared for. This transit sometimes occurs when changes on the domestic front leave us feeling "alone in this world," such as when we move out on our own, are separated from loved ones, or similar circumstances, but it's a time that passes and leads to significant improvements--patience is needed! Don't push, find ways to rest more, work on improvements and strengthening rather than brand new ventures. Take things step by step, set achievable goals, and remind yourself that your "realistic" look at yourself or your life is probably too harsh.
Feb 1996 <br><br>A time when distractions and dreams can lead you to lose contact with reality, in a mostly positive way. You can be telepathic right now, or at least very perceptive, as your sensors for subtleties are working extremely well. Intuition serves you nicely at the moment. You might speak about dreams and fantasies, give advice to someone in need, persuade someone. Don't be surprised if you are not in top mental gear today. You could find yourself struggling to communicate or being easily misunderstood. Hard words are possible. You may be impulsive and bold, and, as a result of a lack of forethought, might encounter some problems during this brief transit.
Mar 1996 <br><br>A change of schedule can throw you off for a bit, but the detours you take as a result can be interesting. You seem to attract unusual circumstances. You're feeing more serious or responsible right now, and this frame of mind leads you to areas of your life you want to shape up or fix. A good time for gaining credibility or respect. You are more disciplined today, so take advantage. This is a period when you are more interested in everything around you, in your social life, and in your community. You are more aware of the problems of society, and your more idealistic side is stimulated in a pleasant manner.
April 1996 <br><br>A period when it's best to lay low, to seek peace and tranquility, and to let yourself dream. Dreams can seem disruptive now, filling your head, it seems, at all the wrong times. You may feel overwhelmed by routine or things to do. Watch for taking your dreams for reality. Distancing yourself from your dreams is difficult, so that the best thing would be to make some room for your imagination, take holidays if you can, lay low and channel your dreams so that they become positive and they make you stronger instead of weaken your resolve. ou seem to be walking straight ahead, coping with problems as they come and go, and drawing upon the necessary self-control. You might commit yourself completely and get to the very end of an objective you have set for yourself, with success.
May 1996 <br><br>This might be a time of relationship tests, struggles, or trials. You may not be attracting things and people you want into your life as easily as you were in the past, and this can be eye-opening. It's a signal to work on improving your manner as well as the things that you offer to others in partnership. There may be many doubts raised now and you could be withdrawing or holding back a little as you attempt to figure out what you need, want, and can give. You are working towards ridding yourself of self-delusions regarding close partnerships, socializing, and attractiveness. In the process, you might feel disdain for superficial interactions and resent "going through the motions". Others seem to bring out the less flattering side of yourself, or you see the unflattering side of others--and often both! Your goal is to find deeper connections to others. Relationships built on weak foundations may not survive the strain of this transit, but other relationships can be improved and strengthened.
June 1996 <br><br>You are thinking about, or talking about, your past and your memories. A nice conversation with a family member or a young person is quite possible. You want to go out, move about, see friends. Your curiosity is stimulated. Thinking is smarter because you're considering your feelings and your mind is working at the same time.
July 1996 <br><br>You are full of energy, and can take on the work of Hercules. You can be eager to share your ideas and you may be especially expressive. It's a good time to be objective about--or to analyze--what drives you and the things you feel passionate about.
Aug 1996 <br><br>Keeping a grip on reality can be a bit challenging at this time and cases in litigation can take a completely different course due to sudden shocking evidence that comes up. Sometimes clean breaks from the past and others are the best kind and this is not the time to mix business and pleasure. Sudden justices can arrive of the unexplainable kind and relationships can come alive now, taking interesting new paths. You can experience some lack of direction and impulse spending can develop, but you may also enjoy new things that help round out your life.
Sept 1996 <br><br>You are more sensitive to--and frustrated by--anything that makes you feel stifled, restricted, oppressed, or restrained now. Your desire for independence or to feel unique and original is strongly stimulated, but you may not be going about it in the best manner. In fact, you might come across as rebellious, cantankerous, or hard to please. You can be especially impatient, impulsive, or prone to taking foolish risks during this transit that usually lasts a few days. This stems from the desire to make changes in your life or to shake things up because you are sensitive to that which is boring, monotonous, or stale in your life. Try not to be dramatic with making changes.
Oct 1996 <br><br>You are looking to harmonize, blend, and cooperate. You are more attractive or compromising. Feelings are strong and affections feel good. A good time for romance, decorating, pampering, beauty treatments, parties, and social events. Listen to your heart. A time when distractions and dreams can lead you to lose contact with reality, in a mostly positive way. You can be telepathic right now, or at least very perceptive, as your sensors for subtleties are working extremely well. Intuition serves you nicely at the moment. You might speak about dreams and fantasies, give advice to someone in need, persuade someone.
Nov 1996 <br><br>Excellent time for love and your social life. If you haven't already met that special someone, you may meet your lover during this period. Otherwise, you are more attractive right now. You turn more heads than usual. Gifts might come. It's a generally good time for making purchases, recognizing the value of things, seeing eye to eye with others, sharing, decorating, and artwork. All things considered, your timing or confidence are strong now, leading to good outcomes. You are motivated and you're guided by a strong inner direction.
Dec 1996 <br><br>Your vitality gets a boost. Cooperation comes easily. Friendships and connections are favored. Some calm moments are of great benefit now. You have lots of energy but you might act without thinking of the consequences. There can be some problems due to this haste or your uncontrolled tongue! Irritable moods.
Jan 1997 <br><br>You are looking to harmonize, blend, and cooperate. You are more attractive or compromising. Feelings are strong and affections feel good. A good time for romance, decorating, pampering, beauty treatments, parties, and social events. Listen to your heart. Your loving feelings are wide awake. You are attracted to a love interest's charms and might easily fall for someone or for a dream of love. These feelings are more physical than intellectual. Your senses awaken, and you can feel in top form, wanting to socialize or do something fun and exciting. You are strongly focused on creativity, love and/or sexuality right now. You can be filled with the desire to create something wonderful or beautiful. Your personal appeal is stronger, and you may feel freer to express yourself.
Feb 1997 <br><br>This might be a time of relationship tests, struggles, or trials. You may not be attracting things and people you want into your life as easily as you were in the past, and this can be eye-opening. It's a signal to work on improving your manner as well as the things that you offer to others in partnership. There may be many doubts raised now and you could be withdrawing or holding back a little as you attempt to figure out what you need, want, and can give. You are working towards ridding yourself of self-delusions regarding close partnerships, socializing, finances, and attractiveness. In the process, you might feel disdain for superficial interactions and resent "going through the motions" on a social and/or emotional level.
Mar 1997 <br><br>Your loving feelings are wide awake. You are attracted to a love interest's charms and might easily fall for someone or for a dream of love. These feelings are more physical than intellectual. Your senses awaken, and you can feel in top form, wanting to socialize or do something fun and exciting. You are strongly focused on creativity, love and/or sexuality right now. You can be filled with the desire to create something wonderful or beautiful. Your personal appeal is stronger, and you may feel freer to express yourself.
April 1997 <br><br>You can be nervous, have bad reflexes, be clumsy during this phase. You might throw yourself into action without thinking of the consequences. You need space and independence. You are inclined to rebel against all authority, all routine, any constraint. You might lead a more erratic life, eating and sleeping at any old time. You may be curt, have bursts of anger without your circle knowing what has happened to you. You might wear or do eccentric things, trying on new images. You could have some surprises or shocks, as much at work as in your emotional life. This is a period of experimentation.
May 1997 <br><br>While this is technically a challenging aspect, it's one of the better ones! Even so, there is a tendency to wastefulness and faulty decision-making due to over-optimism or arrogance now. Avoid making any large purchases during this transit, as you might find that once Jupiter passes, you didn't really need the item. Jupiter boosts your ego, and it is up to you how to handle it. Your ambitions may outstrip your abilities just for now. You may be too vain, impertinent, or self-satisfied. Watch for abusing the good things in life--too many big meals or substantial over-spending, for example. Your methods for achieving success could be against the rules. Avoid making decisions that you know in your heart are not for the better good.
June 1997 <br><br>One of the major sources of stress and guilt in our lives stems from uncertainty--undue stress comes from overestimating our responsibilities and inevitably failing to meet them. Things nag at the back of our minds. However, this Saturn transit offers you a nice dose of realism. You see yourself, especially, more clearly and realistically. This transit tends to reduce the uncertainty, at the very least with regards to our capabilities, and offers a welcome reprieve from feelings of guilt and fear. At this time in your life, you know what your responsibilities are, and you meet them.
July 1997 <br><br>You can be attracted to an unusual person whose charm bewitches you. You are transformed by love and encounter passion that may have been heretofore missing in your life. You may fall in love during this period, and if the transit is already in effect, you may have already met someone who affects you deeply. This can be a very consuming relationship - one that is filled with passion and that cannot be taken lightly. There is great depth of feeling and attachment. You are energized, intrigued, and in love. You may engage in more sexual activity than usual. Alternatively, this can be a time for a new pleasure or hobby that is consuming and involving. This might also be a time for an improved financial state. Strategy in business and with money comes more easily.
Aug 1997 <br><br>Feelings are promiment. Life is more colorful and you are especially sensitive. Something or someone speaks your emotional language now. A better time to bond with others and to take care of domestic matters. Be careful in love. It's not the time to ask for favors. There could be feelings of rejection today. You may feel the weight of responsibilities, especially social, romantic, and financial ones, more acutely today. This feeling will pass. Remember your worth but don't give into the the temptation to prove yourself to others. Be patient.
